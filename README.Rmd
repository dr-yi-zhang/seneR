## Overview

seneR is an open-source R package for assessing the senescence level of samples based on RNA-seq counts data. Using this tool, researchers can quickly obtain quantitative assessments of senescence and senescence-related phenotypes, thereby gaining biological insights. For single-cell RNA-seq, this tool can also identify senescent and non-senescent cells, and draw senescence trajectories, which is beneficial for understanding the cell senescence process. The tool is a valuable shovel for mining biological insights of senescence from the vast repository of omics data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of seneR like so:

``` r
{r,eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("pacman", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("pacman")
library(pacman)
pacman::p_load(GSEABase, GSVA, dplyr, tidyverse)
devtools::install_github("dr-yi-zhang/seneR")
```

## Usage

### Load the seneR environment:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(seneR)
env_Load() 
```

### Input RNA-seq data

Read the bulk RNA-seq sample data provided by this package (raw counts & metadata):

```{r}
example_expr <- read.csv(system.file("demo", "GSE246425_counts.csv", package = "seneR"),row.names = 1)
example_expr[1:4,1:4]
example_meta <- read.csv(system.file("demo", "GSE246425_meta.csv", package = "seneR"),row.names = 1)
head(example_meta)
```

The example dataset (GSE246425) is a bulk RNA-seq dataset of chondrocytes isolated and cultured from human cartilage, including young group (passage 1-3) and old group (serial passaging to passage 15-18).

### Senescence level (SID score) assessment:

The machine learning-based prediction model can automatically identify the senescence prediction model (SID1\~6) suitable for each input sample and calculate the senescence score (SID score).[@tao2024]

```{r}
SID_res <- SenCID(example_expr)
score_res <- SID_res$score_res
```

Plot boxplots based on the grouping of Meta information:

```{r}
plot_group(score_res, example_meta, 'group','SID_Score',comparisons = list(c('Old','Young')))
```

From the plot, we can see that the senescence level of the old group is significantly higher than that of the young group.

### Senescence-related phenotype assessment:

Based on the collected genes associated with various aging-related phenotypes (such as genomic instability, stem cell exhaustion, mitochondrial dysfunction, etc.), we organized them into gene sets and achieved quantitative evaluation of various aging-related phenotypes through the GSVA algorithm.

```{r}
gsva_res <- seneGSVA(example_expr)
```

Plot violin plot based on the grouping of Meta information:

```{r}
plot_violin(gsva_res,example_meta,'group', adjust_fdr = TRUE, p_threshold = 0.05)
```

From the figure, we can see that not all phenotypes are different between the two groups. Among them, the levels of NF-kB and SASP in the old group were significantly higher than those in the young group, which is consistent with the conclusions of previous osteoarthritis studies.

### For scRNA-seq data

The Seurat package is the most widely used R package for scRNA-seq analysis on R, and the following is an example of the use of seneR with a seurat object. Of course, users can also input their own seurat objects or a separate count matrix.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Seurat)
# Use the sample seurat object provided by SeuratData
library(SeuratData)
options(timeout = 600)
SeuratData::InstallData("pbmc3k")
pbmc3k <- LoadData("pbmc3k", type = "pbmc3k.final")
```

Calculate the SID score for each cell

```{r}
expr_matrix <- GetAssayData(pbmc3k,layer = "counts")
SID_res <- SenCID(expr_matrix,binarize = TRUE) # "binarize" can distinguish cell senescent/non-senescent by binary classification
pbmc3k@meta.data <- cbind(pbmc3k@meta.data,SID_res$score_res) # Add the evaluation results to the metadata
```

Visualizing senescence assessment results

```{r}
VlnPlot(pbmc3k, features = "SID_Score", group.by = "seurat_annotations")
DimPlot(pbmc3k)
DimPlot(pbmc3k, group.by = "RecSID")
DimPlot(pbmc3k, group.by = "Binarization") #Visualizing senescent/non-senescent cells. 1 for senescent and 0 for non-senescent.
FeaturePlot(pbmc3k, features = "SID_Score")
```

Plotting the trajectory of senescence

This function draws the senescence trajectory of cells by fitting differentially expressed genes with SID score.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(monocle)
seneCDS <- sene_traject(pbmc3k,color = "SID_Score",cores = 7)
seneCDS <- sene_traject(pbmc3k,color = "seurat_annotations",cores = 7) #Gain insights by observing annotated cell subpopulations on trajectories
```

Finding genes that have a kinetic tendency associated with senescence by plotting a heat map

This function draws the senescence trajectory of cells by fitting differentially expressed genes with SID score.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
sene_heatmap(seneCDS, num = 20, num_clusters = 3) #Set the number of genes to be displayed and the number of clustered expression patterns

```

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
genes <- c('CDKN1A','IL1B','SDHA')
seneCDS_subset <- seneCDS[genes,]
plot_genes_in_pseudotime(seneCDS_subset, color_by = "SID_Score")
```
